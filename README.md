  <sub>AVX2 may be faster than SSE2 though not all CPUs support it (`Steam > Help > System Information > Processor Information > AVX2`). Freetype uses freetype as the text rasterizer and includes some custom fonts, which results in better looking text but larger DLL sizes. PDBs are for developer use. </sub>

  <sub>If nightly.link is down or can't be accessed, you can still download through [GitHub](https://github.com/TheGameEnhancer2004/Amalgam-v2/actions) with an account. </sub>
  <br><br>
  <sub>Textmode doesnt fully make the game textmode. You need to preload [TextModeTF2](https://github.com/TheGameEnhancer2004/TextmodeTF2) module to make the game textmode.
